lipsum
======

Lipsum is a program used to generate lorem ipsum text and to test help output for the command module.

If the -l | --latin option is specified and it looks like latin then it does nothing, other more meaningful options that have an affect are interspersed, try --align and --format in particular. The examples are valid, they illustrate some of the functionality of the command module.

When invoked without no arguments the program will print some lorem ipsum paragraphs.
